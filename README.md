# operator-skeleton
A skeleton to bootstrap a new operator

## Usage

Clone the repo and run `rename.sh` to perform the necessary replacements.
The script takes one parameter, which is the _pretty_ name of the component, so for example "ZooKeeper". 
This will be formated as needed to "zookeeper" and "Zookeeper" to adhere to Rustfmt guidelines.
