= Stackable Operator for Apache Druid

This is an operator for Kubernetes that can manage https://druid.apache.org/[Apache Druid] clusters.

WARNING: This operator does _not_ work with containers/container images. It relies on the https://github.com/stackabletech/agent/[Stackable Agent] to run on "bare metal" via systemd.
