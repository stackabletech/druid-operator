:description: Druid requires an SQL database for metadata and supports various deep storage options like S3, HDFS, and cloud storage

Druid uses an SQL database to store metadata.
Consult the https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/dependencies/metadata-storage.html#available-metadata-stores[Druid documentation] for a list of supported databases and setup instructions.

## Feature specific: S3 and cloud deep storage

https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/dependencies/deep-storage.html[Deep storage] is where segments are stored.
Druid offers multiple storage backends. For the local storage there are no prerequisites.
HDFS deep storage can be set up with the xref:hdfs:index.adoc[Stackable Operator for Apache HDFS].
For S3 deep storage or the Google Cloud and Azure storage backends, you need to set up the storage.

Read the xref:usage-guide/deep-storage.adoc[deep storage usage guide] to learn more about configuring Druid deep storage.
