Druid uses an SQL database to store metadata.
Consult the {druid-available-metadata-stores}[Druid documentation] for a list of supported databases and setup instructions.

== Feature specific: S3 and cloud deep storage

{druid-deep-storage}[Deep storage] is where segments are stored.
Druid offers multiple storage backends.
For the local storage there are no prerequisites.
HDFS deep storage can be set up with the xref:hdfs:index.adoc[Stackable Operator for Apache HDFS].
For S3 deep storage or the Google Cloud and Azure storage backends, you need to set up the storage.

Read the xref:usage-guide/deep-storage.adoc[deep storage usage guide] to learn more about configuring Druid deep storage.
