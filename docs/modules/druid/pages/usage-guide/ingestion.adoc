=== Adding external files, e.g. for ingestion

Since Druid actively runs ingestion tasks there may be a need to make extra files available to the processes.

These could for example be client certificates used to connect to a Kafka cluster, a keytab to obtain a Kerberos ticket, or similar things.

In order to make these files available the operator allows specifying extra volumes that will be added to all pods deployed for this cluster.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    extraVolumes:
      - name: google-service-account
        secret:
          secretName: google-service-account
----

All `Volumes` specified in this section will be made available under `/stackable/userdata/\{volumename\}`.
