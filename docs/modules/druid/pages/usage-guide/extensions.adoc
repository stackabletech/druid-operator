= Druid extensions

https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration/extensions/[Druid Extensions] are used to provide additional functionality at runtime, e.g. for data formats or different types of deep storage.

== [[default-extensions]]Default Extensions

Some extensions are loaded by default:

- `druid-kafka-indexing-service`
- `druid-datasketches`
- `prometheus-emitter`
- `druid-basic-security`
- `druid-opa-authorizer`
- `druid-hdfs-storage`

Some extensions are loaded conditionally depending on the `DruidCluster` configuration:

- `postgresql-metadata-storage` (when using PostgreSQL as metadata store)
- `mysql-metadata-storage` (when using MySQL as metadata store)
- `druid-s3-extensions` (when S3 is used as deep storage)
- `simple-client-sslcontext` (when TLS is enabled)

== [[custom-extensions]]Custom Extensions

Druid can be configured load any number of additional extensions:

[source,yaml]

spec:
  clusterConfig:
    additionalExtenions:
      customExtensions:
      - druid-avro-extensions
      - druid-google-extensions
      ...
----

Some extensions require additional configuration which can be added to the `runtime.properties` file using xref:configuration-and-environment-overrides.adoc[configuration and environment overrides].
