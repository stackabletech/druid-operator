= Pod placement

You can configure the Pod placement of the Druid pods as described in xref:concepts:pod_placement.adoc[].

The default affinities created by the operator are:

1. Distribute all Pods within the same role (brokers, coordinators, historicals, middle-managers, routers) (weight 70)

Some of the Druid roles do frequently communicate with each other.
To address this, some affinities will be created to attract these roles:

*For brokers:*

1. Co-locate with historicals (weight 60)
2. Co-locate with middle-managers (weight 40)

*For routers:*

1. Co-locate with brokers (weight 40)

*For historicals and middle-managers:*

1. Co-locate the middle-managers and historicals with the hdfs datanodes if hdfs is used as deep storage (weight 50)

*For coordinators:*

- No affinities
