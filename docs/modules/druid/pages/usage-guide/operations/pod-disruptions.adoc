= Allowed Pod disruptions

You can configure the allowed Pod disruptions for Druid nodes as described in xref:concepts:operations/pod_disruptions.adoc[].

Unless you configure something else or disable our PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs), we write the following PDBs:

== Brokers
We only allow a single broker to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.

== Coordinators
We only allow a single coordinator to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.

== Historicals
We only allow a single historical to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.

== MiddleManagers
We only allow a single middleManager to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.

== Routers
We only allow a single Router to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.
