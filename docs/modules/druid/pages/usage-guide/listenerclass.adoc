= Service exposition with ListenerClasses
:description: Configure Apache Druid service exposure using ListenerClass to control service types: cluster-internal, external-unstable, or external-stable.

Apache Druid offers a web UI and an API, both are exposed by the `router` role.
Other roles also expose API endpoints such as the `broker` and `coordinator`.
The Operator deploys services called `<name>-<role>` (where `<name>` is the name of the DruidCluster and `<role>` is the role for the Service) through which Druid can be reached.

These services can have three different types: `cluster-internal`, `external-unstable` and `external-stable`.
Read more about the types in the xref:concepts:service-exposition.adoc[service exposition] documentation at platform level.

This is how the listener class is configured:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    listenerClass: cluster-internal  # <1>
----
<1> The default `cluster-internal` setting.

This setting affects all role Services at once.
