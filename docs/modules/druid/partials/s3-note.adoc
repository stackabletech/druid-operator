[NOTE]
====
You can specify just a connection/bucket for either ingestion or deep storage or for both, but Druid only supports a single S3 connection under the hood.
If two connections are specified, they must be the same. This is easiest if a dedicated S3 Connection Resource is used - not defined inline but as a dedicated object.

TLS for S3 is not yet supported.
